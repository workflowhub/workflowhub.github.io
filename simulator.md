# Workflow Simulator

An alternative to conducting scientific workflow research via real-world 
experiments is to use simulation, i.e., implement a software artifact that 
models the functional and performance behaviors of software and hardware 
stacks of interest. 

Simulation is used in many computer science domains and can address the 
limitations of real-world experiments, e.g. they are confined to application 
and platform configurations available at hand, and thus cover only a small 
subset of the relevant scenarios that may be encountered in practice.
