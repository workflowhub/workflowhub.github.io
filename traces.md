# Workflow Execution Traces

Workload traces are widely used to profile and characterize workflow executions, 
and to build distributions of workflow execution behaviors, which are used to 
evaluate methods and techniques in simulation or in real conditions.

## List of Workflow Execution Traces

In this page, we keep a list of workflow execution trace repositories that host 
traces compliant with the **[The WorkflowHub JSON format](json.html)** for 
describing workflow executions.

Workflow execution traces are organized into sub-folders within the repositories. 
Each sub-folder represents a workflow application, which itself contains sub-folders 
for workflow executions in different computing platforms. For each workflow 
application, a `README.md` file provides detailed description of the workflow
structure and pointers to relevant material.
